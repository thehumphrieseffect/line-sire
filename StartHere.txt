Project Overview
This workflow enables the creation of a polyline FC with near analysis and xy management. Specifically, a point and ployline FC is leveraged as inputs for the script to execute. This is intended to be run locally and further data management is required.

Problem:
Utility specific GIS data lacked wLateral lines from wMeter pits to the wMain lines.

Solution:
Automate the creation of new polylines (wLateral) from a point FC (wMeters) to a polyline FC (wMains). XY and Near Analysis do the heavy lifting as a starter for further editing and management.
